<!-- TODO: continue to update short project description, some sample screenshots or mockups -->

Our team is developing an application to support Dartmouth's pong culture.

This addresses the competitive needs of the sport (designing a ranking system to help match players at the same skill level) as well as its social aspects (helping players quickly find partners and track their games).

## Architecture

<!-- TODO: continue to update descriptions of code organization and tools and libraries used -->

We are using MongoDB, Express, Expo, and Bun.

This repository contains a TypeScript monorepo which mirrors the structure of the application.

### Frontend
The [frontend](./frontend) directory contains source code and instructions to build, run, and deploy a static site or mobile application using the Expo framework.

### Backend
The [backend](./backend) directory contains source code and instructions to build, run, and deploy a server application.

This server is built with Express, and connects to a MongoDB database.

## Setup

Install [`bun`](https://bun.sh), then refer to the [frontend](./frontend) and [backend](./backend) directories for specific instructions on how to build, run, and deploy the client and server applications.

> [!WARNING]  
> Currently, there is a bug with Expo + Bun in the frontend - it spawns a Node process under the hood,<br>
> and if it falls back to Bun then Bun will throw some errors during frontend bundling.
>
> Make sure you have Node.JS â‰¥23 installed - we suggest [`nvm use node`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
