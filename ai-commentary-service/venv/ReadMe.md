# AI Commentary Service

This project is an AI commentary agent built using FastAPI for the backend. The service processes inputs such as video-action logs and provides real-time summaries and analytics for a game. It is designed to be modular, allowing you to integrate computer vision and NLP components easily.

## Overview

The backend application:

- Is implemented in Python using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).
- Provides endpoints to log actions, generate game summaries, and process video files.
- Can serve as a microservice that integrates with a frontend (e.g., Node/React) or other backend services.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+**: Ensure Python is installed and accessible from your terminal.
- **Virtual Environment**: Recommended for dependency isolation (e.g., `venv`).
