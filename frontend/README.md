# Frontend

<!-- TODO: add sections and organize as in root README.md -->

### Getting started

1. Install [bun](https://bun.sh/)
2. Clone this repo and `bun install`
3. `cd frontend`
4. `bun web` to start a development server in your browser.

> [!WARNING]  
> Currently, there is a bug with Expo + Bun in the frontend - it spawns a Node process under the hood,<br>
> and if it falls back to Bun then Bun will throw some errors during frontend bundling.
>
> Make sure you have Node.JS â‰¥23 installed - we suggest [`nvm use node`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
