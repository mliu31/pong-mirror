# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

We used Expo due to ease of testing. Under the hood, it's still react native.

But the annoying bits of compiling that come with react native are handled by expo.


### Getting started

1. Install [bun](https://bun.sh/)
2. Clone this repo and `bun install`
3. `cd frontend`
4. `bun run dev` to start a local live server.

### Scripts
